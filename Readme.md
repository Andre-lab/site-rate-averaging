# Mansucript repo
This a repository for data from the manuscript "Improved prediction of site-specific evolutionary rates from structure by averaging across homologs"

The repo contains:
1. The python script to calculate site-rates from ddG values, and an example command line
2. Example command line for calculating ddG values from a protein structure
3. Data from the manuscript

# Site-rates from TMS
TMS calculations requires the script
